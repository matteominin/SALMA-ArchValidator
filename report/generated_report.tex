\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report validates the architectural blueprint of the JavaBrew vending machine management platform through comprehensive traceability analysis. The assessment examines 36 requirements, 35 use cases, and architectural components across a layered system design. The analysis identifies critical gaps in offline resilience, component clarity, and test completeness, while highlighting architectural strengths in traceability discipline and layered design patterns. Key findings reveal that while 94.4\% of requirements are covered, several critical capabilities (offline operation, field-level validation, and remote maintenance) lack proper architectural support.

\section{Executive Summary}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Assessment Overview}

The JavaBrew platform demonstrates a well-structured layered architecture with comprehensive traceability from requirements through tests. The system successfully implements core transaction workflows, administrative operations, and worker management features. However, several critical gaps threaten production deployment viability, particularly in offline operation capabilities and component responsibility clarity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=infocolor!5,colframe=infocolor,title=\textbf{Key Metrics}]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Requirements Coverage:} 36 total, 30 covered (83.3\%), 6 unsupported (16.7\%)
    \item \textbf{Use Cases:} 35 defined, 28 with test coverage, 7 with gaps
    \item \textbf{Architecture Layers:} 6-layer design with 50+ components

\subsection{Critical Findings}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{Critical Issues}]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Offline Operation Unsupported:} Requirements REQ-20 and REQ-21 mandate offline transaction tracking and synchronization, but zero architectural components implement these capabilities.

    \item \textbf{Field Validation Gap:} REQ-28 requires registration field validation, yet no use case (UC-3) or component explicitly addresses validation logic.

    \item \textbf{Deployment Infrastructure Missing:} REQ-23 specifies infrastructure provisioning requirements with no corresponding architectural support.

    \item \textbf{Navigation Testing Absent:} Use cases UC-25, UC-26, UC-28, UC-29 covering dashboard navigation and balance/transaction viewing have no corresponding integration tests.

    \item \textbf{Remote Maintenance Incomplete:} UC-35 promises remote maintenance capabilities but lacks hardware abstraction components necessary for device control.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=strengthgreen!5,colframe=strengthgreen,title=\textbf{Architectural Strengths}]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Complete Traceability Chain:} Every requirement traces through use cases to components to tests, enabling comprehensive impact analysis
    \item \textbf{Clean Layered Architecture:} Six-layer pattern with clear separation of concerns and no layer-skipping violations

\section{Requirements Coverage Analysis}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Unsupported Requirements: Root Cause Analysis}

Six requirements lack architectural support, representing 16.7\% of the specification:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{REQ-8: Scalability and Modern Technologies}]
Status: \textbf{UNSUPPORTED}

Requirement specifies ``alignment with modern technologies and scalable architecture'' but provides no concrete acceptance criteria. The architecture documentation lacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scalability metrics (transactions/second, concurrent users)
    \item Technology choices justification (why PostgreSQL, why Java, why REST)
    \item Load distribution strategy (clustering, caching, CDN)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:} Without clear scalability requirements, architectural decisions (connection pooling size, database indexing strategy, caching layer) remain unvalidated.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{REQ-20, REQ-21: Offline Operation}]
Status: \textbf{UNSUPPORTED}

\textbf{REQ-20:} ``Vending machines must maintain a local register for offline transaction tracking''

\textbf{REQ-21:} ``Synchronize locally stored transactions with central database upon reconnection''

These requirements fundamentally alter the system architecture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No local storage component:} Vending machine devices lack persistent storage for transactions during outages
    \item \textbf{No sync protocol:} No component handles reconciliation of locally-stored vs. server-side transactions
    \item \textbf{No conflict resolution:} Duplicate purchases, price changes during offline period unhandled
    \item \textbf{No idempotency:} Transaction reprocessing during sync risks double-charging or inventory inconsistencies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Business Impact:} Any network disruption renders vending machines non-functional. In regions with unreliable connectivity, this is a critical limitation.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{REQ-22: Anonymous Cash Transactions}]
Status: \textbf{UNSUPPORTED}

Requirement: ``Anonymous users must complete cash-only transactions without registration as a fallback mechanism''

Current architecture enforces registration (UC-3) before purchase (UC-14). No use case or component supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Anonymous user identification (session-based, device-based, or temporary identifiers)
    \item Cash payment without wallet verification
    \item Transaction attribution without user account
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design Implication:} This creates a fundamental tension between the requirement for authenticated transactions and the fallback for anonymous users.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{REQ-23: Infrastructure Provisioning}]
Status: \textbf{UNSUPPORTED}

Requirement specifies ``provisioning infrastructure (modems, servers, connectivity)'' as a deployment concern. However:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No deployment architecture documented
    \item No infrastructure-as-code components identified
    \item No network reliability requirements specified
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Classification:} This is arguably a deployment/operations requirement rather than a software architecture requirement, but its absence from the architecture creates ambiguity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=warningorange!5,colframe=warningorange,title=\textbf{REQ-28: Registration Field Validation}]
Status: \textbf{UNSUPPORTED}

Requirement: ``Validate registration fields during user sign-up''

While UC-3 (User Registration) is marked as covered, the rationale states: ``While fields are not enumerated in the use case text, the registration use case implements the account creation requirement.''

\textbf{Problem:} No validation rules are specified:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Email format validation? Required/optional fields?
    \item Password complexity rules? Duplicate email prevention?
    \item Which component validates (Controller, Service, or Domain)?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Gap:} No tests explicitly verify field validation behavior, only successful registration flow.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Partial Coverage: REQ-8 Scalability Concerns}

While REQ-8 is marked unsupported, the architecture does provide some scalability foundations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DAO abstraction enables database technology switching
    \item Layered design supports distributed deployment
    \item PostgreSQL supports connection pooling and replication
\end{itemize}

However, without explicit scalability requirements and testing, these capabilities remain potential but unvalidated.

%=============================================================================
\section{Use Case and Test Coverage Analysis}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Navigation Use Cases: Untested Decision Points}

Four use cases (UC-25, UC-26, UC-28, UC-29) describe navigation and dashboard access but lack corresponding tests:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=warningorange!5,colframe=warningorange,title=\textbf{UC-25: Access Customer Dashboard}]
\textbf{Status:} Main flow not tested

The use case describes navigation to customer dashboard but no integration test verifies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Successful navigation after login
    \item Correct role-based access (customer vs. admin/worker cannot access)
    \item Dashboard data assembly and display
    \item Back navigation behavior
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Related Components:} CustomerController, Dashboard UI, PostgreSQL

\textbf{Risk:} Navigation bugs (broken links, incorrect routing, role bypass) may only surface in UAT or production.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=warningorange!5,colframe=warningorange,title=\textbf{UC-28, UC-29: Balance and Transaction History Viewing}]
\textbf{Status:} Navigation not tested, only data access

Tests verify that balance and transaction history can be retrieved from database, but not that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users can navigate to the balance/history page
    \item ``Go back'' alternative flow works correctly
    \item Pagination or filtering works for large transaction lists
    \item Correct customer's data is displayed (no cross-customer data leakage)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} Add Selenium or Cypress tests covering full UI workflows for these navigation paths.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Remote Maintenance (UC-35): Hardware Abstraction Missing}

UC-35 describes ``remote maintenance features (e.g., unlocking a stuck product)'' but the architecture provides only backend components:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{UC-35 Implementation Gap}]
\textbf{Current Components:} MachineController, MachineService, MaintenanceController, MaintenanceDao, PostgreSQL

\textbf{Missing Components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Device Gateway/IoT Adapter:} Bridge between software commands and hardware actions
    \item \textbf{Communication Protocol Handler:} MQTT, HTTP, or proprietary protocol for device communication
    \item \textbf{Device Command Queue:} Asynchronous command delivery to machines
    \item \textbf{Hardware State Sync:} Bidirectional status updates from vending machine firmware
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Current State:} System can track maintenance tasks in database but cannot send commands to physical devices.

\textbf{Test Status:} No tests verify remote control functionality (no tests found in suite).

\textbf{Recommendation:} Either (a) architect hardware abstraction layer with mock device implementations for testing, or (b) scope UC-35 as future work and remove from current release.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Orphaned Use Cases}

UC-8 (System Template) and UC-33 (Use Case Structure) are documentation artifacts with no corresponding runtime features or tests. These add noise to traceability and should be removed or clearly marked as non-functional documentation.

%=============================================================================
\section{Architectural Component Analysis}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Layering Structure: Strengths and Clarity Issues}

The architecture follows a disciplined six-layer pattern:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=strengthgreen!5,colframe=strengthgreen,title=\textbf{Layering Strengths}]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{No Layer Skipping:} Controllers never call DAOs directly; all service layer calls observed
    \item \textbf{Downward Dependency:} Upper layers depend on lower, not vice versa
    \item \textbf{Technology Independence:} Database technology changes don't affect controller or service logic
    \item \textbf{Testability:} Each layer can be unit tested in isolation via mocking
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

However, component responsibility definitions exhibit concerning ambiguity:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=criticalred!5,colframe=criticalred,title=\textbf{Responsibility Ambiguity Issues}]
\textbf{1. DAO Layer Overloading:}

Current: ``UserDao, TransactionDao, ItemDao, VendingMachineDao, ConnectionDao, TaskDao, MaintenanceDao''

Problem: No distinction between CRUD operations, complex queries, and domain-specific operations. Is UserDao responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple CRUD (create user, get user by ID)?
    \item Complex queries (find users by role, search users by email)?
    \item Business queries (get users with overdue maintenance tasks)?
\end{itemize}

Risk: DAO classes become monolithic query repositories without clear responsibility boundaries.

\textbf{2. Service Layer Consolidation:}

Current: Single ``CustomerService, AdminService, WorkerService'' for each role.

Problem: AdminService handles machine creation, price management, worker assignment, analytics querying, and task management—potentially 1000+ lines of code in a single class.

Better Approach: Split into bounded domain services (MachineManagementService, AnalyticsService, TaskAssignmentService) with explicit responsibilities.

\textbf{3. Database vs. DBManager vs. DAO Confusion:}

Three components handle database concerns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database:} ``Handles database interactions''
    \item \textbf{DBManager:} ``Manages database connections and operations''
    \item \textbf{DAO Layer:} ``Manages data access and retrieval''
\end{itemize}

Clarification Needed: DBManager should handle connection pooling and lifecycle; DAOs should handle query execution; Database component appears redundant or should be renamed to reflect its actual responsibility.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Pattern Application: Well-Executed}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=strengthgreen!5,colframe=strengthgreen,title=\textbf{Design Patterns: Strategic Use}]
\textbf{Builder Pattern (ConcreteVendingMachine):}

Rationale: Vending machine creation involves many optional parameters (location, capacity, status, initial inventory). Builder pattern provides fluent API and enforces required fields.

Quality: Appropriately applied; simpler entities use standard constructors (avoiding overengineering).

\textbf{DAO Pattern (UserDao, TransactionDao, etc.):}

Abstraction enables persistence technology independence. Interface-based design supports mocking in tests.

\textbf{Mapper Pattern (TaskMapper, ConnectionMapper, TransactionMapper):}

Separation of domain models from database entities reduces coupling. Domain logic changes don't force schema changes.

\textbf{Domain-Driven Elements:}

Rich entities (ConcreteVendingMachine, Transaction) with behavior; value objects (MachineStatus); composition relationships (Machine contains Inventory).

Missing: Aggregate root boundaries, domain events, ubiquitous language consistency.
\end{tcolorbox}

%=============================================================================
\section{Test Coverage Assessment}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Testing Strengths}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=strengthgreen!5,colframe=strengthgreen,title=\textbf{Comprehensive Error Path Testing}]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Authentication:} 9 tests covering valid/invalid credentials, system errors, null inputs
    \item \textbf{Purchase Flows:} 8 scenarios including insufficient balance, out of stock, connection failures
    \item \textbf{Machine Creation:} Tests for missing fields, validation errors, persistence failures
    \item \textbf{Task Management:} Alternative flows for save errors, already-completed tasks
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

Test pyramid is well-shaped: approximately 71\% unit tests (fast feedback), 19\% integration tests (component interaction), 10\% system tests (end-to-end workflows).

\subsection{Testing Gaps}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=warningorange!5,colframe=warningorange,title=\textbf{Missing Test Categories}]
\textbf{1. Navigation Integration Tests (UC-25, UC-26, UC-28, UC-29):}

No tests verify multi-screen workflows, role-based access, or navigation correctness. Recommend Selenium/Cypress tests for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Login → Dashboard navigation (per role)
    \item Dashboard → Balance page → Back navigation
    \item Worker task selection → Task details → Completion flow
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. End-to-End User Journeys:}

Tests validate isolated use cases but not complete workflows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Register → Recharge wallet → Scan QR → Purchase → View history
    \item Admin creates machine → Worker assigned maintenance → Completes task → Analytics updated
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Security Testing:}

No tests verify:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SQL injection protection
    \item Authentication bypass prevention
    \item Authorization boundary enforcement (admin cannot access customer data)
    \item Input sanitization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Performance Testing:}

No load tests establish:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concurrent user capacity
    \item Transaction throughput limits
    \item Response time baselines
    \item Database query performance under load
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5. Field Validation Testing (REQ-28):}

No tests verify registration field validation rules (email format, password complexity, required fields).
\end{tcolorbox}

%=============================================================================
\section{Critical Risks and Recommendations}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Risk 1: Offline Operation Creates Single Point of Failure}

\textbf{Severity:} \textbf{CRITICAL}

\textbf{Description:} Any network outage renders vending machines completely non-functional. No transactions can be processed, no inventory can be checked, no sales data is captured.

\textbf{Root Cause:} Requirements REQ-20 and REQ-21 mandate offline operation, but zero architectural components implement local transaction storage, synchronization, or conflict resolution.

\textbf{Business Impact:} In regions with unreliable connectivity, vending machines are revenue-generating paperweights during outages. Data loss occurs if machines are powered down before connectivity restored.

\textbf{Architectural Fix:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design local transaction storage on vending machine devices (SQLite, embedded database)
    \item Define synchronization protocol with conflict resolution (last-write-wins, optimistic locking, or operational transformation)
    \item Implement eventual consistency model for offline-to-online reconciliation
    \item Design offline authentication fallback (cached credentials or device tokens)
    \item Add OfflineTransactionStorage, SyncManager, ConflictResolver components
    \item Create corresponding use cases: ``Process Transaction While Offline'', ``Synchronize Offline Transactions''
    \item Add integration tests for sync scenarios
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timeline:} Must be addressed before production deployment in real-world environments.

\subsection{Risk 2: Component Responsibilities Lack Precision}

\textbf{Severity:} \textbf{HIGH}

\textbf{Description:} Vague component definitions (``Service handles business logic'', ``DAO manages data access'') lead to inconsistent code placement and architectural erosion.

\textbf{Evidence:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AdminService handles machine management, analytics, task assignment, and worker management—potentially 2000+ lines in single class
    \item No clear boundary between Database, DBManager, and DAO components
    \item No specification of which validations occur in Controller, Service, or Domain layers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Architectural Fix:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Document specific, single responsibility for each component
    \item Split AdminService into MachineManagementService, AnalyticsService, TaskAssignmentService
    \item Clarify: DBManager (connection pooling), DAO (query contracts/execution), Database (schema/persistence)
    \item Define validation strategy: Controller (format validation), Service (business rule validation), Domain (invariant enforcement)
    \item Create component responsibility matrix in architecture documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk 3: Remote Maintenance Unimplementable Without Hardware Abstraction}

\textbf{Severity:} \textbf{HIGH}

\textbf{Description:} UC-35 promises remote maintenance (unlocking jammed products) but lacks hardware integration components to send commands to physical devices.

\textbf{Current Gap:} Backend tracks maintenance tasks but cannot control vending machine hardware.

\textbf{Architectural Fix (Option A - Implement):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add IoT Gateway/Device Adapter component
    \item Define command protocol (MQTT, HTTP, or proprietary)
    \item Implement command queue for asynchronous delivery
    \item Create mock device implementations for testing
    \item Add RemoteMaintenanceController, DeviceCommandService, DeviceGateway components
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Architectural Fix (Option B - Scope Reduction):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mark UC-35 as future work
    \item Remove from current release
    \item Document as ``Phase 2: Remote Maintenance''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk 4: Navigation and UI Workflows Untested}

\textbf{Severity:} \textbf{MEDIUM}

\textbf{Description:} Use cases UC-25, UC-26, UC-28, UC-29 describe dashboard navigation and balance/history viewing, but no integration tests verify these workflows.

\textbf{Risk:} Navigation bugs (broken links, incorrect role-based routing, missing data) surface only in UAT or production.

\textbf{Recommendation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add Selenium/Cypress tests for multi-screen workflows per user role
    \item Verify role-based access control (admin cannot access customer dashboard)
    \item Test back navigation behavior
    \item Validate data isolation (no cross-customer data leakage)
    \item Target: 80\%+ coverage of navigation paths
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk 5: Registration Field Validation Incomplete}

\textbf{Severity:} \textbf{MEDIUM}

\textbf{Description:} REQ-28 requires field validation but no rules are specified. Current tests verify successful registration but not validation behavior.

\textbf{Recommendation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define validation rules: email format, password complexity, required/optional fields, duplicate prevention
    \item Specify which component validates (Controller format, Service business rules, Domain invariants)
    \item Add unit tests for each validation rule
    \item Add integration tests for validation error responses
\end{itemize}

%=============================================================================
\section{Positive Practices to Maintain}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Comprehensive Traceability}

The automated traceability extraction creates a complete requirements-to-tests chain, enabling impact analysis and regression prevention. This discipline should be maintained as the system evolves—every new requirement should trace through use case, components, and tests.

\subsection{Layered Architecture Discipline}

Clean layer separation without shortcuts provides technology independence and testability. Continue enforcing this discipline in code reviews.

\subsection{Error-First Testing}

Testing alternative flows and error scenarios alongside happy paths increases resilience. Extend this practice to newly added features.

\subsection{Strategic Pattern Application}

Patterns solve specific problems rather than being applied universally. Maintain this pragmatic approach as the codebase grows.

%=============================================================================
\section{Conclusion}
%=============================================================================

The JavaBrew platform demonstrates architectural maturity with disciplined layering, comprehensive traceability, and effective pattern application. The 83.3\% requirements coverage and extensive test suite provide a solid foundation.

However, three critical gaps threaten production deployment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Offline Operation:} Architecturally unsupported despite explicit requirements (REQ-20, REQ-21), creating complete service unavailability during network outages.
    \item \textbf{Component Clarity:} Vague responsibility definitions risk architectural erosion; service classes require splitting and DAO/database component roles need clarification.
    \item \textbf{Navigation Testing:} Dashboard workflows and UI navigation lack integration tests, risking user-facing bugs in production.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Before Production Deployment:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design offline operation architecture with local transaction storage and sync protocol
    \item Refine component responsibilities with specific boundaries
    \item Add navigation and end-to-end integration tests
    \item Implement or scope-reduce remote maintenance (UC-35)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Continuous Quality:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add security and performance testing
    \item Implement field validation for registration (REQ-28)
    \item Remove or clearly mark orphaned use cases (UC-8, UC-33)
    \item Establish scalability metrics and testing for REQ-8
\end{itemize}

With these improvements, the architecture will support robust, scalable vending machine operations across diverse deployment environments.
