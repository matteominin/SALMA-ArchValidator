Critical Findings
Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention:
#
Critical Issue
1
Offline Operation Gap: Three requirements for disconnected operation (local
transaction tracking, offline-online synchronization, anonymous cash transactions)
are completely unsupported by the architecture, creating a single point of failure
on network connectivity.
2
Component Responsibility Ambiguity: Multiple core components lack pre-
cise responsibility definitions, violating the Single Responsibility Principle and
risking architectural erosion.
3
Remote Maintenance Unimplementable: The remote maintenance use case
lacks hardware abstraction components, making the promised remote control func-
tionality unimplementable.
Architectural Strengths:

Critical Gap Analysis
CRITICAL: Complete Offline Capability Missing
Three requirements specify behavior when vending machines lose Internet connectivity,
but the architecture provides zero support for offline operations.
Business Impact:
Severity
Impact
Critical
Machine downtime during out-
ages
Critical
Complete revenue loss
High
Poor user experience
Critical
Single point of failure
Missing Components:
#
Component
1
Local transaction storage
2
Sync protocol + conflict resolution
3
Eventual consistency
4
Offline auth fallbacks
Root Cause: Architecture assumes always-on connectivity—a fundamentally flawed as-
sumption for distributed IoT devices.
Recommended Actions (High Priority):
#
Action
1
Design local storage layer (SQLite/embedded DB on vending machine firmware)
2
Define synchronization protocol with conflict resolution strategy
3

Issues & Recommendations
Issue REQ-60: Remote Maintenance
Use case UC-18 promises remote maintenance capabilities but architecture lacks hardware
abstraction layer, IoT communication protocol, and device gateway components. Gap:
Task assignment and tracking are implemented, but remote hardware control is not—a
disconnect between promised capability and architectural reality.
Recommended Actions:
#
Action
1
Clarify REQ-60 scope (diagnostics only vs. full remote control)
2
If full control required: design IoT gateway, specify protocol (MQTT), define command-
response model
3
If diagnostics only: update UC-18 to reflect read-only access and add telemetry collection
2.6
Architectural Overview
The system implements a six-layer architecture following classic separation of concerns prin-
ciples:
Layer
Responsibility
Key Components
Presentation
UI components and user interac-
tion
Web UI, Mobile mockups, User
interfaces
Controller
HTTP routing and input valida-
tion
UserController,
MachineCon-
troller, TransactionController

Business logic orchestration
CustomerService, AdminService,
WorkerService

Dao, MachineDao
Persistence
ORM and database connections
JPA/Hibernate,
DBManager,
Connection pools
Domain Model
Business entities and value ob-
jects
ConcreteVendingMachine, Trans-
action, Inventory
Layering Benefits: Controllers delegate to services, services call DAOs—no layer skipping
observed. Dependencies flow downward, enabling technology substitution and independent layer
testing.
The architecture employs three key design patterns:
Page 13


--- Page 14 ---
JavaBrew Platform
Architectural Validation Report
• Builder Pattern for complex object construction (ConcreteVendingMachine)
• DAO Pattern for persistence abstraction (all data access objects)
• Mapper Pattern for separating domain models from database entities
The domain model follows Domain-Driven Design principles with rich entities (ConcreteVend-
ingMachine, Transaction, Inventory), value objects (MachineStatus), and clear compositional
relationships.
2.7
Architectural Strengths
The architecture demonstrates several key strengths:
1. Clean Layer Separation — No layer-skipping violations detected. Controllers delegate to
services, services call DAOs, maintaining strict architectural boundaries. This enables indepen-
dent testing and technology substitution.
2. Strategic Pattern Application — Patterns are applied where they solve specific problems,
not universally. Builder pattern only for complex objects, avoiding overengineering in simpler
entities.
3. Technology Independence — The architecture allows swapping PostgreSQL for another
database or replacing REST with GraphQL without affecting business logic—only persistence
and controller layers would change.
4. Rich Domain Model — Entities contain both state and behavior rather than being anemic
data containers. Transaction encapsulates transaction logic, ConcreteVendingMachine handles
vending operations.
5. Testability — Services can be tested with mock DAOs, DAOs can be tested against in-
memory H2 databases, enabling fast feedback loops.
2.8
Critical Weaknesses & How to Improve
1. Vague Component Responsibilities
Component descriptions are too generic. DAO Layer is described as "manages data access"—but
what exactly does each DAO handle? Services Layer "contains business logic"—but which logic
belongs where? Without clear boundaries, developers will place responsibilities inconsistently,
leading to monolithic classes and architectural erosion over time.
Recommended Actions:
Page 14


--- Page 15 ---
JavaBrew Platform
Architectural Validation Report
Action
Implementation
Document
DAO
Re-
sponsibilities
Define exact scope for each DAO: UserDao handles only user
CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, findByEmail).
TransactionDao manages financial records only—no analytics
queries. ItemDao contains product data only—inventory counts
belong elsewhere.
Split Services by Con-
text
Instead of generic "business logic," define explicit bounded con-
texts:
PurchaseOrchestrationService for transaction work-
flows,
InventoryManagementService
for
stock
operations,
PricingService for pricing rules.
Clarify
Component
Roles
Document the distinction between DBManager (connection pool-
ing, transaction management), DAO interfaces (query contracts),
and DAO implementations (query execution).
2. Missing Aggregate Root Enforcement
Code can directly modify Inventory without going through ConcreteVendingMachine, potentially
violating business rules like "inventory cannot exceed machine capacity." Data consistency vio-
lations may occur when inventory updates bypass machine-level constraints.
Recommended Actions:
Approach
Implementation
Package-Private
Enforcement
(Recommended)
Make
Inventory
modifications
package-private.
In
Inventory.java,
use
void updateStock(int
quantity)
without
public
modifier.
In
ConcreteVendingMachine.java,
validate
capacity
constraints
before
calling
inventory.updateStock(),
ensuring all inventory changes respect business rules.
Immutable Inventory (Alter-
native)
Make
Inventory
immutable
with
methods
like
withUpdatedStock(int newQuantity)
that
return
new instances.
This forces all updates through the
machine aggregate root, preventing direct modifications.
3. No Domain Events Infrastructure
The system lacks domain events (ProductPurchased, BalanceRecharged, MaintenanceTaskCre-
ated), limiting extensibility for features like asynchronous email notifications, audit logging for
compliance, analytics event streaming, and cross-aggregate coordination. These features will
require tight coupling or workarounds if implemented later.
Recommended Actions:
Page 15


--- Page 16 ---
JavaBrew Platform
Architectural Validation Report
Step
Implementation
Define Event Interface
Create
a
base
DomainEvent
interface
with
eventId(),
occurredAt(), and aggregateId() methods. Implement con-
crete events as records (e.g., ProductPurchased with transac-
tionId, customerId, itemIds, totalAmount).
Implement
Event
Pub-
lisher
Add event collection to domain entities. Each aggregate main-
tains a list of domain events, adding events when state changes
occur (e.g., events.add(new ProductPurchased(...)) when
transaction completes). Provide collectEvents() method to
retrieve accumulated events.
Add Service Layer Pub-
lishing
In
service
layer
after
persisting
ag-
gregates,
collect
and
publish
events:
tx.collectEvents().forEach(eventPublisher::publish).
This decouples event handling from business logic.
Overall Assessment: The architecture is fundamentally sound with excellent layering and
pattern usage. The weaknesses are documentation and enforcement issues rather than structural
problems. Addressing vague component responsibilities will have the highest impact on long-
term maintainability.
2.9
Testing Quality
The test suite contains 63 tests distributed across three categories following the test pyramid
pattern. Figure 2 shows the test distribution.
Unit Tests (71%)
45 tests
Integration (19%)
12 tests
System (10%)
6 tests
Figure 2: Test Distribution Following Test Pyramid (Total: 63 tests)
The distribution follows the test pyramid pattern, prioritizing fast unit tests (71%) while main-
taining adequate integration (19%) and system-level (10%) test coverage. This error-first testing
approach increases system resilience by ensuring graceful degradation.

Cross-Cutting Concerns
3.1
Error Handling & Validation
Issue - Inconsistent Error Response Formats:
Requirements REQ-34 (Authentication errors), REQ-35 (Transaction errors), and REQ-45
(Validation errors) lack structure definition. Tests verify errors occur but don’t specify response
format standards.
Recommendation: Define standardized JSON error response schema with error code, message,
details object, timestamp, and request ID.
3.2
Requirements Quality Issues
Vague Requirements:
Requirement
Issue
REQ-10, 21, 58
"Improved user experience," "operational efficiency"—lack quantifi-
able targets
REQ-8
"Digital payment methods" without provider/compliance specifica-
tion
REQ-60
"Remote maintenance" with undefined scope
Impact: Impossible to validate if architecture achieves goals without measurable criteria.
Recommendation: Add specific, measurable acceptance criteria to all performance/quality
requirements.

#
Critical Gap
1
Offline Operation: Zero architectural support despite explicit requirements—creates sin-
gle point of failure
2
Component Ambiguity: Vague descriptions risk architectural erosion
3
Remote Maintenance: Promised but undeliverable without hardware abstraction
4.3
Final Verdict
The architecture provides a solid foundation suitable for initial deployment in controlled envi-
ronments. Addressing the offline operation gap, clarifying component boundaries, and resolving
remote maintenance will elevate the design to production-grade robustness for diverse deploy-
ment scenarios.
Overall Grade: 22/30
Strong fundamentals with critical gaps requiring resolution before broad
deployment
Page 19


--- Page 20 ---
JavaBrew Platform
Architectural Validation Report
Grading Rationale: The score reflects solid architectural foundations (95.2% requirement
coverage, proper layering, comprehensive testing) offset by three critical gaps (offline opera-
tion, component ambiguity, remote maintenance). The grade of 22/30 indicates above-sufficient
quality but below medium due to production-blocking issues that must be resolved.
Key Insight: The automated traceability analysis proved valuable for identifying gaps early,
before implementation costs make corrections expensive. The 68.8% best practice alignment
validates that findings are based on industry-standard methods, increasing confidence in recom-
mendations.
