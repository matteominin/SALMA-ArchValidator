\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strengths:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clear and coherent description of actors, responsibilities and main use cases.
        \item Architecture is well-structured into Business Logic, Domain Model and ORM packages, with good separation of concerns.
        \item Systematic unit testing strategy for controllers and DAO classes, with 51 tests executed successfully.
        \item Consistent use of design patterns (Strategy, Singleton) and layered persistence design.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Areas for Improvement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Functional and non-functional requirements are implicit in narrative text; there is no dedicated requirements section with identifiers.
        \item Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability) are largely undocumented.
        \item Test descriptions are high-level; explicit mapping from individual test methods to specific use case flows is not documented.
        \item Error handling and failure scenarios are only partially described in use cases and tests.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture Extraction}

\subsubsection{Architectural Pattern}

The architecture is explicitly organized into three main packages: Business Logic, Domain Model and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). This corresponds to a \textbf{Layered Architecture} with clear separation between presentation/business logic and persistence.

\subsubsection{Architecture Components}

\begin{longtable}{p{3.5cm}p{5cm}p{5.5cm}}

\bottomrule
\endlastfoot

Business Logic package & Implements system use cases and coordinates interactions between domain entities and persistence. & Clear separation of concerns; controllers per actor plus a dedicated Notifier component. \\
\midrule
Admin (controller) & Manages creation, modification, deletion and viewing of courses; manages workshifts; views employees and sends payment reminders. & Single class with several responsibilities related to admin actor; cohesive around ``administration'' but somewhat broad. \\
\midrule
TrainerController & Provides trainer operations: view workshifts and courses, view employees and their info, upload/delete/view materials. & Focused on trainer-related operations; interacts with Domain Model and DAO layer. \\
\midrule
CompanyController & Provides company operations: register employees, pay fees, view courses, view materials, view employee info. & Cohesive around company actor; encapsulates fee strategy selection logic via DAO. \\
\midrule
Notifier & Singleton component that sends HTML emails to companies and trainers via SMTP (Gmail). & Good centralization of notification logic; explicit use of Singleton pattern. \\
\midrule
Domain Model package & Contains core domain entities and value types independent of persistence and controllers. & Clean domain-centric design; uses Strategy and enum types. \\
\midrule
Subscription & Represents an employee's subscription, including number of meetings, fee paid flag, associated Employee and FeeStrategy. & Encapsulates subscription state; depends on FeeStrategy for fee calculation. \\
\midrule
FeeStrategy / SingleEmployeeFee / MultipleEmployeeFee & Strategy pattern for computing subscription fee depending on whether a single or multiple employees are registered. & Good use of Strategy; supports extension and encapsulates discount logic. \\
\midrule
Employee & Represents an employee with personal data, associated Subscription and Company. & Standard entity; relationships to Company and Subscription are explicit. \\
\midrule
Company & Represents a company with identification data and list of employees. & Aggregates employees; used by controllers and DAO. \\
\midrule
Trainer & Represents a trainer with personal data and list of Workshifts. & Simple entity; supports scheduling. \\
\midrule
Workshift & Represents a workshift with date and start time. & Used for scheduling trainers and courses. \\
\midrule
Material (abstract), Slide, Video & Abstract multimedia content with upload metadata and trainer reference; Slide and Video specialize it. & Good abstraction for different media types; supports extension. \\
\midrule
Course & Represents a course with date, time, description and FocusCourse category. & Central entity for scheduling and catalog. \\
\midrule
FocusCourse (enum) & Enumerates allowed course categories. & Simple, type-safe categorization. \\
\midrule
ORM package & Contains DAO classes and ConnectionManager to handle persistence via JDBC. & Clear persistence layer; DAOs per entity; uses Singleton for connection. \\
\midrule
ConnectionManager & Manages a single JDBC connection to PostgreSQL using Singleton pattern. & Optimizes resource usage; centralizes connection handling. \\
\midrule
SubscriptionDAO & CRUD and query operations for Subscription, including fee strategy updates and unpaid company retrieval. & Encapsulates fee-related queries; supports business logic in controllers. \\
\midrule
WorkshiftDAO & Manages Workshift entities and mapping between trainers and workshifts. & Provides various retrieval methods (all, per trainer, per date). \\
\midrule
CompanyDAO & Manages Company persistence and retrieval. & Standard DAO; supports listing and lookup by id. \\
\midrule
TrainerDAO & Manages Trainer persistence and retrieval, including shifts and lookup by email. & Used in TrainerDAOTest; supports authentication-like queries. \\
\midrule
MaterialDAO & Manages multimedia content persistence, including upload by filename and retrieval by filename. & Uses filename as key; abstracts file storage details. \\
\midrule
EmployeeDAO & Manages Employee persistence and retrieval, including queries by company and mapping to Company and Subscription. & Complex mapping logic; reconstructs Subscription and FeeStrategy from DB. \\
\midrule
CourseDAO & Manages Course persistence and retrieval, including mapping to FocusCourse and lookup by date/time. & Encapsulates course-related queries and mapping to enum. \\
\midrule
Database (PostgreSQL) & Relational database storing all domain entities and relationships. & ER and logical schema documented; supports integrity constraints. \\
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Architecture Analysis}

\textbf{Summary:} The architecture follows a clear layered pattern (Business Logic, Domain Model, ORM, Database) with good separation of concerns. Controllers encapsulate actor-specific operations, the domain model is clean and pattern-based, and DAOs isolate persistence logic.

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear package-level separation between business logic, domain entities and persistence.
    \item Appropriate use of design patterns (Strategy for fees, Singleton for connection and notifications).
    \item DAOs encapsulate SQL and mapping logic, keeping domain classes persistence-agnostic.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observations and Minor Gaps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Some controller classes (e.g., Admin) aggregate many responsibilities; further decomposition into service classes could improve cohesion.
    \item Error handling and transaction management strategies in the persistence layer are not described in detail.
    \item No explicit description of presentation/UI layer implementation beyond mockups.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Extraction}

The Testing section describes test organization and several representative test classes. Individual test method names are not fully listed, but logical test suites and their purposes are described.

\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Test Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The report states that all \textbf{51 tests} across ORM and Controllers packages completed successfully.
    \item Tests are ordered using JUnit's \texttt{@TestMethodOrder} to ensure logical sequences for DAO operations (insert, retrieve, update, delete).
    \item Each test includes cleanup logic to maintain independence and repeatability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture Consolidation Summary}

\textbf{Analysis Summary:} The consolidated architecture is coherent and consistent with a typical three-layered enterprise Java application. Responsibilities are mostly well-separated, and the use of DAOs and domain entities is clear. The main missing piece is an explicit description of the presentation technology and error-handling strategies.

\section{Detailed Analysis}

\subsection{Requirements Quality Assessment}

\subsubsection{Issues and Recommendations}

\textbf{Requirements needing more detail:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REQ-4 (notifications on course changes):} Does not specify timing (immediate vs. batch), failure handling or email content. \textbf{Recommendation:} Define when notifications are sent and what happens if email delivery fails.
    \item \textbf{REQ-5 (workshift management):} Groups several operations; does not specify constraints (e.g., overlapping shifts). \textbf{Recommendation:} Split into separate requirements and define business rules for scheduling.
    \item \textbf{REQ-6 (view employee data):} Does not specify access control or privacy constraints. \textbf{Recommendation:} Clarify which actor can see which fields and under what conditions.
    \item \textbf{REQ-7 (payment reminders):} Does not specify reminder frequency or channels. \textbf{Recommendation:} Define schedule (e.g., weekly) and escalation rules.
    \item \textbf{REQ-10 (material notifications):} Only upload success is mentioned. \textbf{Recommendation:} Clarify whether updates and deletions also trigger notifications.
    \item \textbf{REQ-13 (fee payment):} Payment method and error handling are not described. \textbf{Recommendation:} Specify payment mechanisms (e.g., bank transfer, card) and what happens on failure. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vague or high-level requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REQ-15 (centralized notifications):} Good design principle but not measurable. \textbf{Recommendation:} Add acceptance criteria (e.g., ``All emails must be sent via Notifier; no direct SMTP calls elsewhere'').
    \item \textbf{REQ-18 (overall goal):} High-level and non-testable. \textbf{Recommendation:} Keep as background but ensure it is refined into concrete functional and non-functional requirements (which is partially done via use cases).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Case Completeness Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Main flows for the six key use cases are clearly described and aligned with actors and architecture.
    \item Alternative flows are present for UC-1, UC-4 and UC-6 (input validation and upload failure), but missing for UC-2, UC-3 and UC-5.
    \item Error scenarios (e.g., database failures, network issues) are not modeled as alternative flows.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} Extend use case templates to include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Error handling for course deletion when the course no longer exists (UC-2).
    \item Behavior when no employees or courses are available (UC-3, UC-5).
    \item Payment failure scenarios (UC-5).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture Quality Evaluation}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Architecture Quality Metrics}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Principle} & \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\midrule
Separation of Concerns & \textcolor{coveredcolor}{Good} & Clear package boundaries and DAO separation. \\
Loose Coupling & \textcolor{coveredcolor}{Good} & Domain model is independent of persistence; DAOs encapsulate SQL. \\
High Cohesion & \textcolor{partialcolor}{Moderate} & Controllers aggregate many operations; could be decomposed into services. \\
Single Responsibility & \textcolor{partialcolor}{Moderate} & Admin and CompanyController handle multiple concerns (courses, employees, payments). \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce service classes (e.g., CourseService, EmployeeService, BillingService) to reduce controller responsibilities.
    \item Document error handling and transaction boundaries in the ORM layer.
    \item Add a brief description of the presentation technology (e.g., JavaFX, web framework) to complete the architecture picture.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Coverage Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Controllers and DAOs are well-covered by unit tests, with 51 tests executed successfully.
    \item Tests follow a logical order for DAOs (insert, retrieve, update, delete) and include cleanup.
    \item There is no explicit mention of integration or system-level tests that exercise full end-to-end flows including UI.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add a small set of integration tests that simulate complete user journeys (e.g., register employee then pay fee).
    \item Document representative test method names and their mapping to use case steps for improved traceability.
    \item Consider adding negative tests for error scenarios (invalid input, database errors).
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}
