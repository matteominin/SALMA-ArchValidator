\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strengths:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clear, explicit use case templates for the main user and admin flows (purchase, library, catalog, subscriptions).
        \item Well-structured layered architecture (CLI, Business Logic, ORM, JDBC, PostgreSQL) with good separation of concerns.
        \item Extensive JUnit 5 test suite covering business logic, domain model pricing strategy, and ORM DAOs, including many failure scenarios.
        \item Consistent use of design patterns (Strategy, Observer, Singleton, DAO) and clear explanation of their roles.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Areas for Improvement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Functional and non-functional requirements are implicit in use cases and code; there is no dedicated requirements section and some qualities (performance, security, usability) are not quantified.
        \item Some alternative flows in use cases are only partially covered by tests (e.g., some admin validation errors, some library edge cases).
        \item No explicit discussion of security, performance, scalability, or deployment architecture beyond basic JDBC/PostgreSQL usage.
        \item Error handling and logging strategies are implemented in code but not documented as architectural policies.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture Extraction}

\subsubsection{Architectural Pattern}

The report describes a clear \textbf{Layered Architecture} with modular packages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CLI (user interface)
    \item Business Logic (controllers and application services)
    \item Domain Model (entities)
    \item ORM / DAO layer
    \item JDBC
    \item RDBMS (PostgreSQL)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Architecture Components}

\begin{longtable}{p{3.5cm}p{5cm}p{5.5cm}}
\caption{Architecture Components Analysis} \\
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Responsibility} & \textbf{Design Notes} \\
\midrule

\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Responsibility} & \textbf{Design Notes} \\
\midrule
\endhead
\midrule
\multicolumn{3}{r}{{Continued on next page}} \\
\endfoot
\bottomrule
\endlastfoot

CLI & Command-line user interface for menus, catalog browsing, cart, library, admin menu. & Clear separation from business logic; acts as presentation layer. \\
\midrule
Business Logic Controllers (UtenteController, CarrelloController, LibreriaController, CatalogoController, StatisticheController, AchievementController, AdminController) & Implement operations defined in use cases: registration, authentication, cart management, purchases, library operations, statistics, achievements, admin catalog management. & Responsibilities are well described; some controllers (CarrelloController, CatalogoController) are central but still focused. Good use of Strategy and Observer patterns. \\
\midrule
Domain Model Entities (Utente, Videogioco, Carrello, Libreria, Abbonamento, StatisticheVideogioco, Achievement, Admin) & Represent core business entities and their attributes and simple behaviors (getters/setters, some logic like price calculation via strategy). & Entities are mostly data containers; Carrello integrates Strategy pattern via PrezzoStrategy. Cohesion is good. \\
\midrule
PrezzoStrategy and concrete strategies & Calculate videogame prices depending on subscription type (Gold, Silver, NonAbbonato). & Classic Strategy pattern; improves flexibility for pricing rules. \\
\midrule
Observer (CarrelloController as Subject, LibreriaController as Observer) & Notify library when a purchase is completed so that games are added and messages are shown. & Good use of Observer to decouple purchase from library update; security checks in observer. \\
\midrule
ORM / DAO Layer (UtenteDAO, VideogiocoDAO, CarrelloDAO, LibreriaDAO, AbbonamentoDAO, StatisticheVideogiocoDAO, AchievementDAO, AdminDAO) & Provide CRUD operations for each entity, mapping domain objects to PostgreSQL tables. & Clear DAO responsibilities; SQL is parameterized; methods like findByCriteria support flexible queries. \\
\midrule
DatabaseConnection (Singleton) & Provide a single access point to PostgreSQL connections using JDBC. & Singleton pattern; simple but effective for this context. \\
\midrule
PostgreSQL Database & Store all persistent data: users, games, carts, libraries, subscriptions, statistics, achievements, admins. & Schema documented via ER diagram; test scripts ensure consistent state. \\
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Architecture Analysis}

\textbf{Summary:} The architecture follows a clear layered pattern with good separation of concerns. Presentation (CLI), business logic, domain model, and persistence are separated. Design patterns (Strategy, Observer, Singleton, DAO) are used appropriately.

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear layering and modular packages.
    \item DAOs encapsulate SQL and database access, keeping business logic independent of persistence details.
    \item Strategy pattern cleanly encapsulates pricing rules based on subscription.
    \item Observer pattern decouples purchase completion from library updates.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observations and Minor Gaps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No explicit discussion of transaction management (e.g., ensuring atomicity across multiple DAO calls during purchase).
    \item Error handling is implemented via exceptions but there is no documented global error-handling policy.
    \item Security is limited to simple credential checks; there is no mention of password hashing or protection against SQL injection beyond prepared statements.
    \item Deployment and scalability aspects (e.g., multi-user concurrency, connection pooling) are not discussed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Extraction}

\subsubsection{Test Type Distribution}

All tests are written with JUnit 5 and exercise business logic, domain model, and DAOs. They are effectively \textbf{integration tests} (because they hit a real PostgreSQL database) plus some unit-like tests for Carrello.

\textbf{Test Type} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Percentage} \\

\section{Detailed Analysis}

\subsection{Requirements Quality Assessment}

\subsubsection{Issues and Recommendations}

\textbf{Requirements needing more detail:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REQ-2:} Search criteria are mentioned but not fully specified (e.g., case sensitivity, partial matches). \textbf{Recommendation:} Specify supported search operators and expected behavior.
    \item \textbf{REQ-5:} Statistics are recorded but retention period and precision are not defined. \textbf{Recommendation:} Define how long statistics are stored and at what granularity.
    \item \textbf{REQ-6:} Achievements are unlocked based on time, but other possible conditions are not discussed. \textbf{Recommendation:} Clarify whether only time-based achievements are supported.
    \item \textbf{REQ-7:} Subscription benefits are described qualitatively. \textbf{Recommendation:} Explicitly state discount percentages and rules for free games (e.g., number of free games per month).
    \item \textbf{REQ-12:} Maintainability and scalability are goals but not quantified. \textbf{Recommendation:} Add maintainability goals (e.g., maximum coupling, test coverage) or scalability assumptions (e.g., expected number of users). 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vague or missing non-functional requirements:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item No explicit performance targets (e.g., maximum response time for catalog search).
    \item No explicit security requirements (e.g., password hashing, access control policies).
    \item No usability or accessibility requirements for the CLI.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Case Completeness Analysis}

\subsubsection{Explicit vs. Implicit Use Cases}

All four main use cases are explicitly documented with templates. No additional implicit use cases are strictly required, although one could formalize ``User registration'' and ``User authentication'' as separate use cases, which are currently only described in tests and controller descriptions.

\subsubsection{Alternative Flow Coverage}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strong:} UC-001 and UC-002 have rich alternative flows covering empty cart, insufficient funds, already purchased games, empty library, already installed games, and missing achievements.
    \item \textbf{Moderate:} UC-003 and UC-004 include some alternative flows (invalid credentials, invalid data, insufficient funds, already active subscription) but not all possible error conditions are enumerated.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add explicit use cases or at least templates for user registration and login, since they are central to the platform and heavily tested.
    \item For UC-003 and UC-004, expand alternative flows to cover all validation errors that are implemented in code (e.g., invalid videogame data, invalid achievement parameters).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture Quality Evaluation}

\subsubsection{Design Principles Assessment}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Architecture Quality Metrics (Qualitative)}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Principle} & \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\midrule
Separation of Concerns & \textcolor{coveredcolor}{Good} & CLI, controllers, DAOs, and entities are clearly separated. \\
Loose Coupling & \textcolor{coveredcolor}{Good} & Controllers depend on DAOs via interfaces/constructors; DB details are encapsulated. \\
High Cohesion & \textcolor{coveredcolor}{Good} & Each controller focuses on a specific area (users, cart, library, catalog, etc.). \\
Single Responsibility & \textcolor{partialcolor}{Moderate} & Some controllers (e.g., CarrelloController) handle several responsibilities but still within one domain. \\
Error Handling & \textcolor{partialcolor}{Moderate} & Exceptions are thrown for invalid states; no global error-handling policy is documented. \\
Security & \textcolor{uncoveredcolor}{Weak} & Only basic credential checks; no mention of password hashing or authorization beyond role checks. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Document transaction boundaries for operations like purchase and subscription activation to ensure atomicity.
    \item Introduce a simple error-handling strategy (e.g., mapping exceptions to user-friendly CLI messages) and document it.
    \item Add a short section on security practices (e.g., password hashing, use of prepared statements, minimal privileges for DB user).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Coverage Analysis}

\subsubsection{Coverage by Area}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Business Logic:} Well covered by controller tests, including many negative scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Domain Model:} Carrello is thoroughly tested, especially pricing strategy; other entities are simple and not individually tested.
    \item \textbf{Persistence:} VideogiocoDAO, CarrelloDAO, and LibreriaDAO are tested; other DAOs (UtenteDAO, AbbonamentoDAO, StatisticheVideogiocoDAO, AchievementDAO, AdminDAO) are used indirectly in controller tests but not all have dedicated DAO tests.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add explicit tests for remaining DAOs to ensure full CRUD coverage.
    \item Add integration tests for some missing alternative flows (e.g., empty cart, already active subscription).
    \item Consider adding performance-oriented tests (even simple ones) to measure basic operations like catalog search under load.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}

\subsection{Priority 1: Critical Items}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Formalize Non-Functional Requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add a short section specifying performance, security, and usability requirements (even at a basic level).
        \item \textbf{Action:} Define simple metrics (e.g., response time for catalog search, password hashing requirement, basic usability goals for CLI).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Complete Test Coverage for Key Alternative Flows}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Missing or weakly tested flows: empty cart (UC-001), empty library (UC-002), already active subscription (UC-004), some admin validation errors (UC-003).
        \item \textbf{Action:} Add JUnit tests that explicitly exercise these scenarios and assert correct error messages or behavior.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Document Security and Transaction Handling}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security and transaction management are implemented implicitly but not documented.
        \item \textbf{Action:} Add a short subsection describing how credentials are stored, how SQL injection is prevented (prepared statements), and how multi-step operations (e.g., purchase) are kept consistent.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Priority 2: Important Improvements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Add Explicit Use Cases for Registration and Authentication}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These flows are central and already tested but not documented as use cases.
        \item \textbf{Action:} Create UC templates for ``Register user'' and ``Authenticate user'' with preconditions, steps, and alternative flows (e.g., invalid credentials).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Extend DAO Test Coverage}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some DAOs are only indirectly tested.
        \item \textbf{Action:} Add tests for UtenteDAO, AbbonamentoDAO, StatisticheVideogiocoDAO, AchievementDAO, and AdminDAO similar to VideogiocoDAOTest.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Clarify Scope and Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system simulates gameplay and uses a CLI; these constraints should be explicit.
        \item \textbf{Action:} Add a ``Scope and Limitations'' subsection in the introduction describing what is intentionally out of scope (e.g., real game execution, graphical UI).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Priority 3: Nice-to-Have Enhancements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Add Deployment and Scalability Notes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Even a simple description (single machine, local PostgreSQL) would improve completeness.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Introduce Basic Logging Strategy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Replace System.out.println with a simple logging framework and document log levels.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Summarize Coding Standards}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A short note on naming conventions and code style would strengthen maintainability documentation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
